Moreover, her friendly and supportive demeanour gave me the encouragement and motivation to change my lifestyle for the better.She also emphasised a change in my overall lifestyle and eating habits, rather than being narrowly focused on weight loss. This emphasis, as I soon lernt, is a unique and far more helpful take on nutrition and health.In conclusion, I truly believe that she personifies this wonderful quote on leading a healthy life: 'Health is not about the weight you lose, but about the life you gain'",

  "2" : {"review":"It was a beautiful journey of changes for me from an unhealthy lifestyle to a balanced healthy lifestyle. I am really thankful to those who helped, motivated and supported me through this journey. Earlier I used to do a lot of crash diets to lose weight but Sushma helped me learn the importance of a balanced diet and exercise in our lifestyle. I know what my body and mind needs, kind of nutrition I need to keep my body healthy. I have learnt to keep myself active and the need of atleast a 30mins of workout daily. Now I know how my plates should look and the role of carbohyrates, proteins and also fibers in my diet. I learnt that weight loss is possible by eating foods that I love and not by starving myself or craving for the food that I love. Such a great experience to cherish. Thanks for developing this habit in me and will try ti continue this in future.I am really happy that I dint have to do anything out of the box to lose my weight, could eat everything what was prepared at home in moderation. It's the best programme with best diet plan ever. Thank you so much!",
